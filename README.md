Detecting Hate Speech in Social Media by Shervin Malmasi & Marcos Zampieri

Here is the abstract from the paper

    Abstract
    In this paper we examine methods to detect
    hate speech in social media, while
    distinguishing this from general profanity.
    We aim to establish lexical baselines for
    this task by applying supervised classification
    methods using a recently released
    dataset annotated for this purpose. As features,
    our system uses character n-grams,
    word n-grams and word skip-grams. We
    obtain results of 78% accuracy in identifying
    posts across three classes. Results
    demonstrate that the main challenge lies in
    discriminating profanity and hate speech
    from each other. A number of directions
    for future work are discussed
